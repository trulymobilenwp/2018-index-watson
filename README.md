Deliver Emergency Advice - Harness AI to deliver the right information at the right time during a crisis

- leverage the Android (or iOS/Swift) Chatbot from *Mobile starter kit* to create needed *Watson Chatbot* services*: https://console.bluemix.net/developer/mobile/starter-kits
_make sure they are created in the geo local to you - for example *US South*_
- follow steps to setup environment as it is written in this instruction file: https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/starter-mfp-watson-conversation/blob/master/android/README.md

- instead of using original Mobile Chatbot - use the one in this github: ```FEMA-chatbot.json```

During the challenge replace the ```conversation Workspace id``` in this file ```MainActivity.java``` at the ```doInBackground``` method.
